A C++ program to simulate a computer system memory.  This is the first of a multi-part project concluding with a simple computing machine capable of 
executing  real  programs  compiled  with g++.   The  purpose  is  to  gain  an  understanding  of  a machine,  its  instruction  set  and  how  its 
features  are  used  by  realistic  programs  written  in C/C++

To simulate a computer systemâ€™s memory, create a class to represent a memory whose size is defined at run-time via command-line argument. 
Memory class will include utility member functions to load it by reading a binary file, print its contents with a hex dump, a method to determine if a given address is legal, 
and methods that allow a caller to read or write 8, 16 and 32-bit values from (or to) any legal address.
Program will accept parameters from the command line, read data from a file and print all of its non-error output to standard out (aka stdout) via std::cout and usage or 
file loading error messages to standard error (aka stderr) via std::cerr.
