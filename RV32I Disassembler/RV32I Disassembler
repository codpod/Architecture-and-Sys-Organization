Abstract:
Loads and disassembles a binary RV32I executable file.
This is the second of a multi-part project involving the creation of a machine capable of executing programs compiled with g++.  
The purpose of this part is to gain a thorough understanding of the RV32I instruction set

Description:
Disassemble an executable binary file by loading it into a simulated memory of sufficient size and then decode each 32-bit instruction 
one-at-a-time starting from address zero and continue throughto the end of the simulated memory.
