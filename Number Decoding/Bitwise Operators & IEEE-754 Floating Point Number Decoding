Read 32-bit HEX representations of IEEE-754 Floating Point Numbers, decode them, and print their componenets.

A single-file application that will read zero or more 32-bit hex values and then print a detailed description of the floating 
point value that they represent by extracting and showing the sign, exponent, and significand from the 32-bit value.

 For each input value, the five output lines printed are:

    The first line displays the input value as a 32-bit hex value and again in binary (in groups of 4-bits.)
    The sign bit is zero. (Therefore the floating point value is positive.)
    The exponenet is zero (seen printed as a 32-bit signed integer and as a signed decimal value in parenthesis.)
    The significand is printed as a 32-bit unsigned hex value. In this case it is zero.
    The full value of the number is printed last in binary.

Positive infinity must be displayed like this: +inf and -inf
